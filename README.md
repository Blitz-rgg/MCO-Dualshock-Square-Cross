Modern Controller Overhaul texture extension, designed for DualShock controllers with Square as Attack/Cancel and Cross as Action/Accept.
Ensure you place ABOVE Modern Controller Overhaul and OVERWRTIE current dualshock texture packs. (You may need to delete the OG Dualshock.rtz)
You should keep Texture Replacement enabled in Modern Controller Overhaul

Please credit me (Blitz_rgg) if you do choose to build upon my texture pack for whatever reason.
