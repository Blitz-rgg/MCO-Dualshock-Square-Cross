# MCO-Dualshock-Square-Cross
Custom control scheme for tomtee's Modern Controller Overhaul

Credits to tomtee, pizza1398, Nerrel and GhostlyDark for creating the base mod!!

I would also like to thank Dario and tomtee for their help and advice while I made and compiled the Texture pack!!
Honestly everyone was such a huge help and I'm so grateful that they were paitent enough with me :)

Original repo can be found here -
https://github.com/t0mtee/MMModernControllerOverhaul/

Modern Controller Overhaul texture extension, designed for DualShock controllers with Square as Attack/Cancel and Cross as Action/Accept.
Ensure you place ABOVE Modern Controller Overhaul and OVERWRTIE current dualshock texture packs. (You may need to delete the OG Dualshock.rtz)
You should keep Texture Replacement enabled in Modern Controller Overhaul

Please credit me (Blitz_rgg) if you do choose to build upon my texture pack for whatever reason.
